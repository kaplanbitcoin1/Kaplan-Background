Over the past two years, I have actively participated in the testnet and node setup stages of numerous blockchain projects. During this time, I have deployed nodes across various networks, ensuring that each node is configured to align with the decentralization and sustainability goals of the projects.

My experience spans working with diverse blockchain architectures and quickly adapting to various consensus mechanisms. I have deployed nodes for both permissioned and permissionless networks and contributed as a validator, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of these projects. For each project, I prioritized analyzing requirements and creating configurations that optimized performance while ensuring a sustainable infrastructure.

Additionally, I have taken responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the nodes I’ve set up, applying software updates and security patches. I played an active role in testnet phases by providing valuable feedback to the community and resolving encountered issues, supporting development teams throughout the process. Tasks like performance monitoring and early detection of potential risks have enabled me to contribute to the stability of the networks.

To stay updated with the rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology, I continuously track new standards and innovations, sharpening my technical skills. This extensive experience allows me to support the success of the networks I participate in and create value for their communities.

### For the last two years, I have been deeply involved in advancing blockchain networks, contributing to a diverse range of projects. My expertise covers several key domains, allowing me to tackle unique challenges and drive the success of each network.



## Node Installation and Maintenance

I have deployed and maintained nodes across numerous blockchain ecosystems, ensuring they meet the highest standards of performance and reliability. Each node is configured to align with the specific needs of the project while supporting decentralization and security objectives. Through regular software updates and the application of security patches, I’ve safeguarded nodes from vulnerabilities and ensured compliance with the latest standards. Continuous monitoring has been a cornerstone of my approach. By analyzing uptime and performance metrics, I have proactively identified and resolved potential issues, preventing disruptions and enhancing network stability. My hands-on experience spans permissionless and permissioned networks, allowing me to adapt quickly to diverse blockchain architectures and consensus mechanisms.

## Testnet Participation

Testnets have provided me with an invaluable platform to contribute to blockchain development. By rigorously testing new features, upgrades, and protocols, I have helped refine networks before their mainnet deployment. I’ve worked closely with development teams to identify and resolve bugs, inefficiencies, and potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a seamless transition to production environments. Beyond technical contributions, I’ve delivered actionable feedback on network performance, scalability, and security. My involvement has not only improved the robustness of testnets but has also accelerated their readiness for real-world use cases.
